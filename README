# Socket Programming
Welcome to **Socket Programming** — a personal repository where I document and practice key concepts of Socket programming through hands-on C programs.

## Simple TCP Client-Server
This is a simple TCP socket-based client-server application written in C using Linux system calls. It demonstrates basic socket programming with `socket()`, `bind()`, `listen()`, `accept()`, `connect()`, `read()`, and `write()`.

#### 🛠️ Concepts Covered
`socket()`: Create an endpoint for communication.
`bind()`: Associate socket with a local IP and port (server-side).
`connect()`: Establish connection to server (client-side).
`listen()`: Mark socket as passive to accept connections.
`accept()`: Accept incoming connection from client.
`read()` / `write()`: Data transmission APIs.
`close()`: Graceful shutdown of socket descriptors.
